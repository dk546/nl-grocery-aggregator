# Streamlit Theme Configuration for NL Grocery Aggregator
# 
# This theme creates a "healthy lifestyle" vibe with:
# - Calm green primary color (representing fresh, healthy choices)
# - Light, clean backgrounds for easy reading
# - Soft, modern sans-serif font
# - Subtle use of colors to avoid harsh visuals
#
# Design intent:
# - Primary green (#3BAA4A) suggests freshness and health
# - Light grey background reduces eye strain
# - White secondary background creates clear content separation
# - Dark text ensures good readability
#
# To customize further:
# - Adjust primaryColor for brand alignment
# - Modify backgroundColor for different moods (warmer/cooler tones)
# - Change font to "serif" for a more traditional feel
# - Use backgroundColor="#FFFFFF" for pure white background
